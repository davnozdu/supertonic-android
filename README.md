# Supertonic 3 Android (fork)

Fork of [DevGitPit/supertonic-android](https://github.com/DevGitPit/supertonic-android) upgraded from Supertonic 2 (5 languages) to **Supertonic 3 (31 languages + `na` fallback)** using the [supertonic-3 ONNX weights from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3).

The on-device inference pipeline (Rust + ONNX Runtime + XNNPACK) is unchanged — Supertonic 3 reuses the same four-stage graph (`text_encoder` → `duration_predictor` → `vector_estimator` → `vocoder`) and the same tensor shapes as v2. The fork therefore replaces only the asset bundle, the language tagging, and the surrounding UI; all inference code paths are identical.

## What changed vs. the upstream fork

| Area | Upstream (v1 + v2) | This fork (v3) |
|---|---|---|
| Languages | 5 (en, ko, es, pt, fr) | 31 + `na` fallback |
| Models | Two parallel dirs (`v1`, `v2`), bundled English + downloadable multilingual | Single Supertonic 3 download (~400 MB), one-time |
| Language tagging | `<lang>` only for non-English | Always wrapped (the model has no separate lang embedding) |
| Dash handling | Em-dash → comma only in English path | Em-dash → comma in every language (fixes Russian "Москва — столица" mis-reading) |
| System TTS settings | Reachable only via Android Settings | Direct shortcut from the in-app menu |
| Lexicon | Hand-edited rules (regex / whole word) | Same, plus **bulk accent dictionary import** for tens of thousands of stress-marked words |

## Install

Grab the signed APK from the **[Releases](https://github.com/davnozdu/supertonic-android/releases)** page.

1. On the phone: Settings → Apps → Special access → Install unknown apps → allow your file manager / browser.
2. Tap the APK to install. If `adb install` returns `INSTALL_FAILED_VERIFICATION_FAILURE`, disable **Verify apps over USB** in Developer Options.
3. First launch downloads ~400 MB of ONNX models from Hugging Face — needs Wi-Fi once.

Releases are signed with an **ephemeral CI keystore** that rotates every build, so the upgrade flow is: `adb uninstall com.brahmadeo.supertonic.tts` → install the new APK. To make the identity stable, add `KEYSTORE_BASE64` / `KEY_ALIAS` / `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` / `KEY_PASSWORD` as repository secrets and adjust `.github/workflows/release.yml` to import that keystore instead of generating one.

## Use as the system TTS engine

After installation:

1. Open Supertonic TTS → menu → **System TTS Settings** (or Android Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech output).
2. Set **Preferred engine** to *Supertonic TTS*.
3. Pick any of the 31 languages and test with *Listen to an example*.

Every app that uses Android's TTS API (Voice Aloud, TalkBack, reader apps, navigation, Tasker etc.) will now use Supertonic.

## Pronunciation control

Two layers of user rules, both applied before the text reaches the model:

1. **Lexicon** (menu → Lexicon) — small set of hand-edited rules with regex or whole-word matching. Highest priority.
2. **Accent dictionary** (menu → Lexicon → Import accent dictionary…) — bulk JSON map for stress / pronunciation, e.g. open-source Russian stress dictionaries. Indexed by word, so a 50 000-entry dictionary still runs in milliseconds.

Expected accent dictionary shape:

```json
{
  "замок": "замо́к",
  "Москва": "Москва́",
  "молоко": "молоко́"
}
```

Stress is marked with the combining acute accent **U+0301** placed *after* the stressed vowel. Whether the model actually pronounces the marked syllable as stressed depends on its training data — try a short test through Lexicon first before importing a large file.

Ready-to-import Russian dictionaries (962 K and 615 K entries) live under [`dictionaries/`](dictionaries/) — download the JSON from the release assets, import via the menu.

## Build

CI builds (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) reproduce locally:

```bash
# Requirements: Android SDK + NDK r29, JDK 17, Rust stable with Android targets
./gradlew assembleDebug          # debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease        # unsigned release APK; sign separately with apksigner
```

The Rust crate under `rust/` produces `libsupertonic_tts.so` for `aarch64`, `armv7`, `i686`, `x86_64`. ONNX Runtime is linked dynamically via `onnxruntime-android` from Maven.

## License

Same as upstream. The Supertonic model weights are released under [OpenRAIL-M](https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3) and are downloaded at runtime; they are not bundled in the APK.
